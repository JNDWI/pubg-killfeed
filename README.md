## Install & Update
Installation and updates can be completed simply by downloading and executing `Install.bat` from the [latest release](https://github.com/JNDWI/pubg-killfeed/releases).

This script is a program that simply places the `Observer` folder from the repository directly into the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TslGame\Saved` directory on your PC.


## Numberless Version
This script provides a version of the killfeed where numbers are displayed by default at the bottom right corner of the logo. If you don't need numbers, replace it with the numberless version. Rename the `TeamIcon-numberless` folder inside the `Observer` folder to `TeamIcon`.
